# question 1:

# sum of odd numbers and even numbers:

# l=[1,2,3,4,5,6]
# a=l[0]
# s=0
# b=0
# for i in l:
#     if i%2==1:
#         s+=i
#     elif i%2==0:
#         b+=i
# print("sum of odd numbers=",s)
# print("sum of even numbers=",b)

# output:
# sum of odd numbers= 9
# sum of even numbers= 12

# question 2:

# sum of numbers in the string:

# l=[10,11,5.8,'abc']



# question 3:

# divisible by 2 and square of that numbers:

l=[1,2,5,8,9,11,16,12]
a=[0]
b=0
for i in l:
    if i%2==0:
        b=i
        print(b)
